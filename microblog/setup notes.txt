[create directories microblog and app, so 'md app' and 'md microblog']

cd microblog

venv\Scripts\activate

pip install flask   --if you try to install flask outside of the virtual environment you'll hit errors with access rights, may not be required every time

set FLASK_APP=microblog.py

flask run
